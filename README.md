# Plant Collector



### Problem Statement

Houseplants can bring a lot of joy and life into your home, but their individual needs can vary greatly. As your plant
collection grows, it can be difficult to keep track of watering schedules, soil conditions, fertilizer preferences, etc... 
That's where Plant Parent Helper comes in! It will be a website where you can keep track of your collection and see all
of your plant's individual needs at a glance.
