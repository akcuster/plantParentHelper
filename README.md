# Plant Collector



### Problem Statement

Keeping track of the varying needs of our chlorophyll loving friends only gets harder as our plant collections grow. Combining that with the natural human tendency to quickly grow bored with simple, repetitive tasks is just asking for disaster. My solution is to create a site that gamifies plant care by awarding points for adding plants to your collection and caring for them. Compete against your friends to see who has the lushest indoor tropical paradise!
